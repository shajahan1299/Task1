HTTP :

     -stands for hypertext transfer protocol
     -foundation of data commmunication for the World Wide Web 
     -it was uses HTTP to fetch resources such as HTML documents, image , and other content from web servers
     -defines how messages are formatted and transmitted
     -specifies the actions that web servers should take in response to various commands.

HTTP/1.1 : 

     - first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997
     -several stages of development, and first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1
     -this verison was still is use on the web

HTTP/2 :

     -2015 a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created
     -solves serveral problems that creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate 
     -much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1 and content during the loading process

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP/1.1 AND HTTP/2:

 1) Binary vs Textual :

     HTTP/1.1 : Text-based format for requests and responses 
     HTTP/2 : Binary format, which is more efficient for passing and reduces overhead 

 2)Multiplexing :

     HTTP/1.1 : Requests sequentially, leading to proential delays
     HTTP/2 : Fully multiplexed, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single connection to improves performance

 3)Parallelism :

     HTTP/1.1 : Requires multiple TCP connections for parallelism 
     HTTP/2 : Uses a single connection, enabling better resource loading and reducing latency 

 4)Header Compression :

     HTTP/1.1 : Headers are verbose and add overhead 
     HTTP/2 : Utilizes header compression, minimizing data size and improving efficiency
 
 5) Server push :

     HTTP/1.1 : Doesn't support proactive resource pushing 
     HTTP/2 : Allows servers to push resource (e.g., stylesheets, images) to the client cache before they're explicity requested
